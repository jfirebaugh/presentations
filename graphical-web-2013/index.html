    A friend of mine mentioned he was wanting to hear less about <em>what</em> people
    were building and more about <em>how</em> they built it. I'm going to do my best to
    do that in this talk, so I'll rush through this part about what iD is.

    iD is an editor for OpenStreetMap, a map of the world that anyone can edit and whose
    data is freely available under an open license. It replaced an older, Flash-based
    editor as the default editor on the OpenStreetMap website a few months ago.

  <aside class="notes">
    The most important design goal for iD was to make an editor that was more approachable
    for users who are new to OpenStreetMap. So it prioritizes simple, familiar concepts
    over power user features and covering every possible editing use case. There's another
    editor that covers that ground.

    One of most popular ways to build client-side applications today is to use jQuery as a

    Traditionally, D3 is thought of as a tool for building data-driven visualizations. But in fact, the core of D3 is
    highly general purpose, and is perfectly suitable for the same problem domains as jQuery -- namely just about any
    kind of website or web application other than a completely static page. In fact, viewed in a certain light, jQuery
    and D3 are so similar that I wound up building practically the world's most boring feature comparison matrix.

    Yes, there's one feature missing from D3 in this matrix -- I'll come back to that later.

    But now that I've build an app entirely with D3 and entirely without jQuery, I strongly prefer the former. Why is
    that? Well, actually, I left out a row from the matrix. What D3 has that jQuery doesn't is data binding.

  <h2>Declarative > Imperative</h2>
  <p>Promote the important; demote the unimportant</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    One reason is that D3 allows me to write code in a more declarative way than jQuery, making the relationship between
    my data and its DOM representation explicit and the specific sequence of DOM operations implicit.

    Writing declaratively is an advantage in this domain because the data-DOM relationship is important, and the gory
    details of how to build and maintain that relationship are typically not. Promoting the important and demoting the
    unimportant makes my code clearer, more concise, and easier to understand and reason about.
  </aside>

<section>
  <h2 class="jQuery">jQuery</h2>
  <pre><code data-trim>
$('.layers li').each(function() {
    var li = $(this);
    if (layerVisible(li.data('layer-id'))) {
        li.addClass('visible');
    } else {
        li.removeClass('visible');
    }
});
  </code></pre>

  <aside class="notes">
    Here's an example of what I mean. iD has a list of background layers and indicates the
    currently visible layers via a <code>visible</code> class. Suppose you need to update
    the DOM to match the current state. In jQuery, you have to iterate over each list item,
    and call <code>addClass</code> or <code>removeClass</code> as appropriate. Highly
    imperative approach.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>D3</h2>
  <pre><code data-trim>
items.classed('visible', function(layer) { return layer.visible; });
  </code></pre>

  <aside class="notes">
    Here's the equivalent with D3. It's much shorter and -- once you understand
    the basics of D3 -- the intent is obvious. You're directly declaring the relationship
    between the <code>visible</code> class and the state of the underlying layer.

  <aside class="notes">
    If you start reading about declarative languages, you'll -- not surprisingly -- find a lot of nerds arguing
    about definitions. What makes one language or framework "imperative" and another one "declarative"? There's no hard
    and fast answer. It's more productive to look at it as a spectrum.

    So plotting tools for building and maintaining a relationship between data and a representation of that data on a
    web page on this spectrum, we'd say that Raw DOM APIs are about the most imperative way we could do it; jQuery is
    a bit more declarative, in that it introduces a concept of a collection of DOM elements that can be manipulated as
    a group; and a tool with data-binding like D3 is more declarative still.

    It's interesting to think about what's to the right of D3 on this continuum. I asked on Twitter. Some of the
    suggestions were XSL, frameworks like Angular and Ember that support two-way data binding, which I think is a really
    good answer, and Genghis Khan.

  <h2>Model-View-<span class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">*</span><span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">Whatever</span></h2>
  <p>Frameworks encourage separation of business logic from presentation</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    Ok, frameworks. Virtually all client-side frameworks these days are built around a set of patterns that
    separate the concerns of the application into parts that model the domain and business logic, parts that
    represent the user interface and controls with which users view and interact with the data, and some
    third thing that connects or coordinates or mediates between those two. There are various names with
    various shades of meaning for this third thing, like "Controller" or "Presenter" or "ViewModel". The
    differences are subtle and ultimately not very important, so folks have taken to just calling the third
    part "Whatever". The Model and View that are the important part, because they encourage you to
    separate your business logic from your presentation logic.

  <h2>Model ⇒ View Change</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Backbone: up to you</li>
    <li>Ember/Angular: smart templates</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    I do want to look at one particular aspect of how views and models are coordinated, and that is
    how they deal with change. Both change in a model that needs to produce a change in a view,
    and the reverse, user interaction in the view that needs to be pushed back to the model.

    Start with the forward direction. Different frameworks take different approaches to solving
    this problem.

    Backbone leaves it up to you to rerender your view in response to relevant change events from the model. In
    practice, this means either rerendering the entire template, or introducing what is effectively a secondary
    parallel rendering path, where specific portions of the DOM are updated in response to fine-grained change events.

    Ember and angular recognized this as an antipattern, and provide a template implementation that's smart enough
    to automatically update in response to changes in the model -- providing you work within the constraints of the
    model and observer framework that is provided.

  <h2>Master the Trinity</h2>
  <ol style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Enter</li>
    <li>Update</li>
    <li>Exit</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="notes">
    D3's solution to model to view updates is the data-joined selection.

    If you want to understand D3 at a deep level, master the enter, update, exit trinity.

    The enter selection contains placeholders for elements that exist in the data but not
    in the DOM. The update selection contains existing elements, bound to data, and is
    where most of the action in response to change happens. The exit selection contains
    elements that are going away.

    For iD, D3 data joins provide just the right combination: flexible enough to support
    a completely custom data model and mutation strategy, powerful enough to support
    efficient, targeted updates to the DOM.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Work-minimization Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Declare static properties on the enter selection
    <li>Declare dynamic properties on the update selection
    <li>Batch updates: no individual "instance changed" events
    <li>Filter the selection to the entities which actually changed
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <dl>
      <dt>Declare static structure on the enter selection</dt>
      <dd>
        If something never changes, don't waste time setting it on every render. This is usually things like constant
        CSS class values, input type attributes.

        It's also often the overall structure of the DOM. Set it up once by chaining off the enter selection.
      </dd>

      <dt>Declare dynamic properties on the update selection</dt>
      <dd>
        Things that change go in the update selection. Take advantage of the fact that the enter selection is
        automatically merged into the update selection when you append.
      </dd>

      <dt>Batch updates: no individual "instance changed" events</dt>
      <dd>
        As a consequence of the iD data model, where mutations are expressed as action functions that take as input a
        graph and return a new, modified graph, it doesn't have change events on the level of individual entities.
        There's one change event, indicating that an action took place and the current graph has changed.

        This is actually a good thing, because it means updates are batched. For instance, when you move the map feature
        that represents a rectangular building, you produce new versions of at least five entities: the four corner
        nodes, and the way containing those nodes that represents the building. It would be incredibly inefficient to
        trigger five different change events and update the SVG in five individual steps.
      </dd>

      <dt>Filter the selection to the entities which actually changed</dt>
      <dd>
        So, instead, iD has a single "graph changed" event. However, the history representation is sophisticated enough
        that it's possible to calculate the difference between two versions of the graph. We use that to update the
        minimal set of DOM elements by filtering the selection down to the subset that actually changed.
      </dd>

  <h2>Model ⇐ View Change</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    What about the opposite direction?

    In all frameworks that I know of, changing something in the UI produces a change in a model -- this
    part seems pretty uncontroversial, right. I don't know, maybe Ursine.js is different. And in all
    frameworks that I know of, that change <em>mutates</em> the model: it changes the sole instance
    of that model in place.

    iD has models, and it has views, and it has that third coordinating "whatever" part, but
    the way it handles changes is fundamentally different. In iD, models are immutable -- they don't
    change. You might be thinking that a data model that doesn't change must make for a rather ineffective
    editor, so let me describe what I mean by that.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="img/node-way-relation.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    The OSM data model has three types of entities: nodes, ways, and relations.

    Nodes are geographical, latitude/longitude coordinates. Ways are ordered sequences of
    nodes. And relations organize nodes, ways, and other relations into more or less
    free-form higher-level features.

    Each of those entity types can have key-value tags that describe what the feature
    represents.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="img/graph-1.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    Though it exposes slightly different abstractions in the interface, iD implements the
    OSM data model internally. It has Node, Way, and Relation classes which inherit from a
    generic Entity class, as well as Graph class that is a container for a set of entities
    and their relationships to each other.
  </aside>

<section>
  <img src="img/graph-2.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    Finally, iD has a class that’s used to store the history of an editing session and to implement undo/redo.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="img/graph-3.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    In iD, entities and graphs are immutable. Entity and Graph objects do not change. Instead, editing actions produce
    <em>new versions</em> of entities, and new graphs. The history is a sequence of graphs. Here, for example, the user
    has edited the tags of a relation, producing a new version of that relation and a new graph. Now, here’s the clever
    part: the other entity references in that second graph are referencing the same objects as in the first graph.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="img/graph-4.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    Here's where immutability really pays off: undo.

    The typical implementation of undo involves pairing every action that can be performed with
    and equal and opposite undo action. You wind up doubling the amount of code you need to write,
    and you have to be very careful to keep the do and undo paths in sync or you could end up
    corrupting the edit history.

    In contrast, if entities and graphs are immutable, undoing a change is trivial -- all you
    need to do is adjust the "current graph" reference to point to the previous version, and
    re-render.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="img/graph-5.png">

  <aside class="notes">
    This is an approach that wouldn't have been possible, as far as I know, in any off-the-shelf
    framework. But it was possible with D3 because D3 enforces so few constraints on the representation
    of your data model and on how change is propagated from view back to the models.

    With D3 I have the full power of a real programming language available from
    the start. I can start off with building a static structure with selections,
    and gradually increase the sophistication as needed, adding updates and transitions,
    abstracting and refactoring using all the techniques I would normally use.

    The downside here is that your designers might hate you. So far we've sidestepped
    this by hiring designers that can code in D3. If you have some of those, give
    them a raise.

  <h2>Just Right</h2>
  <p>Pick technology that fits <em>your</em> problem domain.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    In the end, D3 was just right for the problem space of a rich editor for
    geographic data that required a custom data model -- in particular an immutable
    graph -- sophisticated SVG manipulation, and tight control over how to respond
    to partial changes.

    This is not to say that jQuery, Backbone, Ember et al aren't the right choice
    for many other applications -- my advice is to pick the technology that
    best fits the requirements of your problem domain, rather than what's popular, commonly
    recommended as a best practice, ticks the most checkboxes in comparison matrixes,
    or is rightmost on the imperative-declarative continuum.

    That said, I think using D3 as the primary technology is a great fit for many
    more problem domains than is commonly realized. I encourage you to see if it
    fits yours.

    Thank you!
